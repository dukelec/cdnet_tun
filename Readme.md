CDNET TUN
========================

The cdnet_tun tool creates a virtual network on PC for users to communicate with CDNET devices using IP/UDP programming.

Using IP/UDP programming allows multiple software to access the bus simultaneously, avoiding device occupancy concerns.

No IP/UDP protocol stack is required for MCU to communicate with a computer using CDNET.

Currently, only Linux systems are supported, but more systems will be supported in the future.
